            My name is <em>Ziaul Choudhury</em>, which might sometimes hard to pronounce, to make it easy, I can be addressed as <em>Zia(z-ee-y-ah)</em>. I'm originally from <em>Bangladesh</em> which is a <em>South-Asian</em> country surrounded mostly by <em>India</em>. I've been living in <em>U.S.</em> for more than 10 years, and currently a senior <em>Computer Science</em> undergrad student at <em>Lehman College</em>(CUNY). Having keen interests in problem-solving, and passion of science and technology, Iâ€™ve picked the field of <em>Computer Science</em> as my academic major to gain skills and ability to advance/examine innovative software for different technologies. Working with data is one of my favorite field in the area of <em>Computer Science</em>. What I love about data is that we're existing in the world of data, information and knowledge can be turned into beautiful infographics & visualizations. An interesting fact about data is that we humans are creating data from pre-historic age. The cave-arts that have been discovered are actually the graphical form of data at that time. Our reliance on data is becoming a more common factor in our lives. Any social media that we use is data. Most of the researches that we do are based on data. The growth of the business can be based on data. Historical data is helping us look back in past and move forward to future. For example: DNA, the evaluation of the automobile, weather data, and etc.
